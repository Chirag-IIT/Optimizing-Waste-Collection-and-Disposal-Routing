# Optimizing-Waste-Collection-and-Disposal-Routing
This project applies Operations Research techniques to solve a real-world optimization problem. By formulating the scenario into a mathematical model, using Linear Programming, Transportation, or Assignment methods, and validating results with solvers, the project identifies cost-efficient, optimal resource allocation strategies.
