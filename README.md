# üóëÔ∏è Optimizing Waste Collection & Disposal Routing

**Project Title:** Waste Collection & Disposal Routing Optimization  
**Domain:** Vehicle Routing / Waste Management / Operations Research  

---

## üìå Overview  
Efficiently routing waste collection and disposal vehicles is critical for sustainable urban management. This project frames the problem as a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRP-TW) to minimize operational costs and improve service efficiency.

---

## üéØ Objectives  
- Model the routing of collection and disposal vehicles under constraints (vehicle capacities, service time windows, route limits)  
- Generate routing solutions minimizing cost or distance  
- Compare algorithmic approaches (exact / heuristics)  
- Perform sensitivity analysis and visualize routing policies

## üß© Problem Formulation & Approach  

1. **Data & Node Setup**  
   - Define pickup and disposal nodes (with coordinates, demand, service windows)  
   - Specify vehicle fleet capacity, available time windows, cost matrix  

2. **Mathematical Modeling**  
   - Variables: which vehicle visits which node, sequence order, time on arrival  
   - Constraints: capacity, time windows, flow conservation, route continuity  
   - Objective: minimize total cost/distance/time of routes  

3. **Solution Methods**  
   - Use Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations (CVRPTW)  
   - Employ solver (e.g. Gurobi, CPLEX, or open-source solvers) for exact or near-optimal solutions  
   - Heuristic or metaheuristic enhancements (if needed) to scale  

4. **Visualization & Analysis**  
   - Map routes for delivery and pickup  
   - Compare against baseline (e.g., naive or greedy routing)  
   - Perform sensitivity analysis by varying capacities, time windows, node count  

---

## üìä Key Results & Insights  
- The solver provided feasible routes that respect all pickup/disposal windows and vehicle limits  
- Route visualizations clearly show coverage across service zones  
- Sensitivity plots indicate how cost or distance responds to parameter changes  
- The approach demonstrates how OR + routing methods can significantly improve waste collection efficiency  

---

## üöÄ Future Extensions  
- Incorporate stochastic or dynamic arrival of waste (real-time demand)  
- Integrate more advanced heuristics (Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms)  
- Scale to city-level routing with thousands of nodes  
- Add environmental constraints (emissions, fuel consumption)
